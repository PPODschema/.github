# PPOD - Developing data schemas and infrastructure around the Persons-Projects-Organizations-Datasets data pattern

## Introduction

In our work in environmental data management, we have repeatedly observed a pattern where groups collect information
on persons, projects, organizations, and datasets. Seeing this, we have developed a number of data schemas,
vocabularies, and ontologies to help express the interrelationships between these core data classes. 
This organization has been set up to host repositories, discussions, and general development of the PPOD pattern.
